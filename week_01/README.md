Hello! I'm Carolyn, a 2nd year MSCAPP student and I'm excited to learn all things
data viz! In my previous life, I was a research associate at Harvard Business
School (I've since figured out that academia is not for me). In my spare time,
I enjoy daydreaming about my next vacation and exploring new restaurants/creating
disasters in my kitchen when inspiration hits.
