## Week 3

# Class Code:
* covid.csv - NYT country covid data used for in-class example
* index.html & script.js - Thursday lecture code

# Final Project Data
* Data source: <a href="https://github.com/tategallery/collection">Tate Gallery Github

* Description: Metadata (up to Oct. 2014) for around 70,000 artworks that Tate owns or jointly owns with the National Galleries of Scotland as part of ARTIST ROOMS. Metadata for around 3,500 associated artists is also included.

* Why I'm interested: I must confess I don't know a ton about art, but a friend sent a link to
a bunch of data visualizations using different data as inspiration and I really liked the Tate one.
The Tate Galleries are definitely one of my favorites so I thought this would be a fun project idea.

* Thoughts on how you would hope to use this data: I hope to use the artworks and artist data to perhaps
show the timeline of Tate aquisitions over the years by medium, how it was aquired, etc. Another possible
avenue is to use the artwork links to do a color comparison of the works.

* Potential data points: As I stated in the previous bulletpoint, there's tons of data on artist, medium, year
created, aquisition year and links to the image on the Tate website.

* Any concerns about the data: This data has not been actively maintained by the Tate Gallery for some time now (last updated Oct 2014) so the data are outdated. Some links for each artwork are broken (lead to 404 error) which
could be for several reasons including the outdated nature of the dataset (perhaps the piece isn't part of the Tate
collection anymore).

* Identify if source is primary or secondary: Primary
